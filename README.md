## Lesson-13

Let's update our app so that after a user signs-in they are redirected to the home page, also if a user is signed into our application, we don't want them to be able to access the signinandsignup page.
=======
## Lesson-14

We now need to create our cart feature in our application. To start, we'll create our cartIcon and cartDropdown components. Then we'll create the necessary reducer, actions, and types associated to handling hiding and showing the carDropdown component.

# How to fork and clone

One quick note about cloning this project. If you wish to make commits and push the code up after cloning this repo, you should fork the project first. In order to own your own copy of this repository, you have to fork it so you get your own copy on your own profile!

You can see the fork button in the top right corner of every GitHub project; click it and a copy of the project will be added to your GitHub profile under the same name as the original project.

After forking the project, simply clone it the way you would from the new forked project in your own GitHub repository and you can commit and push to it freely!


# After you fork and clone:

## Install dependencies

In your terminal after you clone your project down, remember to run either `yarn` or `npm install` to build all the dependencies in the project.

## Set your firebase config

Remember to replace the `config` variable in your `firebase.utils.js` with your own config object from the firebase dashboard! Navigate to the project settings and scroll down to the config code. Copy the object in the code and replace the variable in your cloned code.

## Lesson-15

We have updated our cart redux files to handle adding an item, we have also connected it to our updated collection-item.

## Lesson-19

Now that we have our cart, it's time to create our checkout page. We need a checkout component for the page and our checkout-item component. We're going to connect the page to our cart reducer; we're also going to make a selector to get the total price.
